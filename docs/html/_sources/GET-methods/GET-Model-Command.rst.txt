GET Model Command
=================

.. http:get:: /api/models/(mid)/commands/(type)/(command)

  Execute a custom model command.

  Plugins may register custom commands to be executed on the server, using an
  existing model as context.  Custom commands are used to perform computation
  on the server instead of the client, and would typically use model artifacts
  as inputs.

  :param mid: Unique model identifier.
  :type mid: string

  :param type: Unique command category.
  :type type: string

  :param command: Custom command name.
  :type command: string

  Additional command-specific arguments may be passed using query strings.
