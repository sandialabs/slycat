Coding Guidelines
=================

* All new Python code in Slycat should follow the guidelines outlined 
in `PEP 8 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`_ with one 
exception: we use two spaces for indentation instead of four.  
We have lots of code that predates those guidelines, but are actively 
updating it as we go along.
