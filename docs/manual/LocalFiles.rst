Local Files
===========

As shown in Figure 15, if you selected *Local*, the next page will display two fields, *File* and *Filetype*.  Adjacent to 
*File*, is the button *Browse*.  Clicking *Browse* brings up a local file browser, which you can use to navigate to the location 
of your data table.  After selecting a file, the file browser closes and the name of your selected file appears to the right of 
the *Browse* button, as shown in Figure 16.  Depending on the format of the selected file, select either *CSV* or 
*Dakota tabular* from the *Filetype* dropdown, followed by *Continue* to read the file.  Note, you can change your mind and read 
the table from a *Remote* host by clicking the *Back* button to return to the previous page.
