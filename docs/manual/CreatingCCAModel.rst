Creating a CCA Model
====================

Slycat™ accepts two file formats for table data, either Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, or Dakota tabular files (generated by 
Dakota [#]_, software which is frequently used to generate ensemble data sets).  If your data is not currently in one of these two 
formats, Excel can be used to create CSV files from most common table formats.  Note that if output metrics have been created 
separately in a post-processing step, they will need to be integrated with the inputs into a single file prior to model creation.  
In a CSV file, we expect to see only a single row of header information consisting of the column names.

From your project page, click on the green *Create* button and select *New CCA Model* from the dropdown list.  A dialog for walking 
you through the process will then pop up, as shown in Figure 14.  The first page of the model creation wizard identifies whether 
the table is located on the local machine or whether the data is held on a remote machine.  Select *Local* or *Remote*, followed by 
*Continue* to advance to the next page of the wizard.
