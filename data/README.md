# Overview

The following datasets are included with Slycat for the tutorials and
for regression testing.

## cars.csv

This was the 1983 ASA Data Exposition dataset. The dataset was collected by
Ernesto Ramos and David Donoho and contains a label plus 8 variables for 406
different cars.  The data contains NaNs in several records.

The original cars.data archive was retrieved from StatLib, the Datasets Archive
located at http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets

The archive was expanded with

    $ sh cars.data

Then, the cars.csv file was extracted from cars.names and cars.data using

    $ python make-cars.py > cars.csv

## waves1.prn, waves2.prn, waves3.prn

These are timeseries data synthesized using the make-prn.py script and
compatible with PRN files generated by electrical simulation codes.
