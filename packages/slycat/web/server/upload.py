"""Functions for managing upload sessions.

An upload session is used to incrementally upload (potentially large) data
before it is parsed and stored in the form of model artifacts.  When an
upload session is created, a new id is generated and a storage location is
created on the filesystem.  The client uses the session id to upload one-to-many
files, each of which may be split in one-to-many parts - splitting files into
parts allows clients to incrementally upload files that might otherwise exceed
request body limits.  Once the client has completed uploading file data, it
notifies the server, and includes a list of part-counts for each file it
uploaded.  This gives the server a chance to validate that it received every
part of every file that the client sent.  Assuming all went well, the file
parts are consolidated into whole files that are passed to a parser plugin
for parsing and storage in a model.  Once parsing is complete, the client
deletes the session, which releases all temporary storage used by the session.
The client may also opt to delete the session before uploading is complete,
cancelling the entire operation.

A "last access" time for each session is maintained and updated whenever the
session is accessed.  If a session times-out (a threshold amount of time has
elapsed since the last access) it is automatically deleted, and subsequent use
of the expired session id will fail.

Each session is bound to the IP address of the client that created it - only
the same client IP address is allowed to access the session.
