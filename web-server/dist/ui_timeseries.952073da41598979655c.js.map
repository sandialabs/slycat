In this table, each column consists of values for a single input or output variable across all runs, and each row holds all of the variable values for a single simulation. Slycat™ accepts two file formats for table data, either Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, or for Dakota users, Dakota tabular files. If your data is not currently in one of these two formats, Excel can be used to create CSV files from most common table formats. Note that if output metrics have been created separately in a post-processing step, they will need to be integrated with the inputs into a single file ahead of time. In a CSV file, we expect to see only a single row of header information consisting of the column names.\\\"\\n        ></i>\\n      </label>\\n      <slycat-remote-browser params=\\\"\\n

Given that these files may end up being quite large, Slycat™ relies on users to select a suitable scratch disk location for creation of this directory. The directory will not be automatically deleted. Its location will be remembered in the .slycatrc file in your home directory and will be the default location provided in future invocations of the time series wizard. If you decide to keep the HDF5 files created by the wizard, they can be read directly into the wizard as a third input format. This can be useful if you want to experiment with seeing the effects of varying the sampling or dendrogram parameter choices for a particular ensemble.\\\"\\n        ></i>\\n      </label>\\n      <div class=\\\"col-sm-8\\\">\\n        <input class=\\\"form-control slycat-remote-interface-prebuilt-field\\\" type=\\\"text\\\" placeholder=\\\"full path for temporary slycat files\\\" data-bind=\\\"value: workdir, attr: {'disabled' : disabled}\\\">\\n      </div>\\n      <div class=\\\"col-sm-offset-4 col-sm-8\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"checkbox\\\">\\n          <label>\\n            <input type=\\\"checkbox\\\" data-bind=\\\"checked: retain_hdf5\\\"> Retain HDF5 files\\n          </label>\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </form>\\n\\n  <div id=\\\"slycat-remote-interface-connect-modal\\\" class=\\\"modal fade\\\" data-backdrop=\\\"static\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"modal-dialog\\\">\\n      <div class=\\\"modal-content zoom-sensitive\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"modal-header\\\">\\n          <h4 class=\\\"modal-title\\\">Connect to host...</h4>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"modal-body\\\">\\n          <form class=\\\"form-horizontal\\\" role=\\\"form\\\">\\n            <slycat-remote-controls params=\\\"hostname:remote.hostname,username:remote.username,password:remote.password,status:remote.status,status_type:remote.status_type,enable:remote.enable,focus:remote.focus,activate:connect,session_exists:remote.session_exists\\\"></slycat-remote-controls>\\n          </form>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"modal-footer\\\">\\n          <button class=\\\"btn btn-primary\\\" data-bind=\\\"click:connect,enable:remote.enable\\\">Connect</button>\\n          <button class=\\\"btn btn-default pull-left\\\" data-bind=\\\"click:cancel\\\">Cancel</button>\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n\";","/* Copyright (c) 2013, 2018 National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC .
